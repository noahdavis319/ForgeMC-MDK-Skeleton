# ForgeMC MDK Skeleton

This repository serves as a basic skeleton for mods created in ForgeMC.<br>
It builds on the Forge MDK and adds Java packages for all common entities created in mods.<br>
<br>
You will need to update `mods.toml` and the `modId` in their respective places, as well as package names, before 
developing your mod.
